The advent raffle in my local christmas market already has a long tradition.
People from all around the city of Frankfurt come here every year to win great prizes and have a Gl√ºhwein or two.
There are prizes for children, teenagers and grown-ups.


But this year the raffle hosted by the local protestantian church is facing new challenges.

How to collect the cash? How can people tell their age and draw according lot numbers? 
How might we replace this physical experience with something fun and engaging?

Introducing Jeezlot. The touchless raffle machine for your local event.

Just insert a coin, you'll be greeted by a Hallelujah - inspired chime.
The selection of your age works without any touch. 

Now it's up to your creativity. Sway your hands next to the machine, just like using a magic wand.

Our AI Jesus engine will then determine an appropriate prize for you within seconds, based on the selected age and some secret magic.
Using the spinning arm, Jeezlot the user through the entire process.


The whole thing is running on an Arduino R3 with the following components:

- One Arduino R3 connected to a Raspberry Pi for wireless & embedded testing.
- A microphone for coin detection
- Three Light sensors ( For contactless selection of age).
- an Ultrasonic sensor (virtual magic wand).
- A Servomotor as (Jesus' hand).
- A 8x32 LED matrix using the MD_MAX72xx & MD_Parola library
- And of course: Plenty of cables
