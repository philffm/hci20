With the introduction of
Face masks in Germany our emotions got swallowed within one day.

But how might our world become in the future - without any emotions?

Could this lead to
dehuminization
on the long run?

Without emotions,
there is no love.

Without love,
ther might be war.

... and we wouldn't like
to see this happening.

Introducing m치semocio.

M치semocio helps you to carry on smiling all-day long - even while wearing your mask.

But don't get too close.

Spread. Protect. Connect.

Masemocio helps you
keep on smiling the entire day.

Keep distance to other people
and set them aware by
sounds and visuals.

And exchange contact
data with other Masemocio
users - even after you met.
Safe for both sides.

Using the embedded Infrared and Bluetooth fingerprints linked to a smart contract in the blockchain, contacts
to other users are automatically tracked in a decentralized way and can be revealed after both users gave their consent. It's like Tinder in real life - but in a safe manner.

Check your daily smiling activity
With the m치semocio companion web app.
Running from your own m치semocio hardware.
Fully decentralized.

The technical MVP is ready today.
Consisting of a extendable mask layer based on an ESP8266 module with OLED Display and distance sensor and a companion web interface running on the standalone webserver.
